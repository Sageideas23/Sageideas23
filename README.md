# üí´ About Me:
Hello My name is Jason. I've been a project manager and a financial analyst for the last 10 years. I've been project managing for the Home Depot since 2024, and have had success with managing over 600 projects. So why do I have a github profile would be a very natural question. I have been interested in Software/Cloud architecture for a very long time and I am in the middle of transiting over. My linkedin profile is below for your convenience. 

I have been interested in Network and Cloud engineering since 2015 but as my construction career took off I found myself putting all my efforts in improving my skillset. I am now doing that in the IT field. 
My concentration has been in Linux administration, Site Reliability Engineering, Cloud architecting on AWS, Azure, GCP, Security Architecting, Data engineering and of course, Data Architecting. As if one wasn‚Äôt enough. All these different avenues require strong experience with Python and automation, as well but not limited to using programs like Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Terraform, and the list goes on. ‚Ä®‚Ä®As I transition into this roll my concentration will be building hands on projects and working on labs that focus on infrastructure migration, containerization, microservices, and common solutions to problems in moving to cloud platforms, there are many. I believe that hands on experience through the platforms I have outlined below will give me a very good understanding of the cloud services and how they integrate.

I will document most if not all of my learnings here on github through different repositories that have been categorized for my reference and yours. I have also taken the liberty of adding my notes and references of continuous education in the notion link below that I update almost every single day.

I am quite excited about learning journey! Have a look around and if interested in sparking up a conversation about the field I would love that! it‚Äôs quite fun!

## üìò My Learning Journey
I've been transitioning from a project management role into a solutions architect role (I said this above, just incase you didn't read the "About Me" Section), and I spent the majority of my time learning new technologies and building projects. I'm also getting better at creating small apps and integrating CI/CD pipelines. I use a variety of different online learning resources that include, but are not limited to:

- Cloud Academy
- Digital Cloud
- LinuxAcademy
- Udemy
- DataCamp
- AWS Skillbuilder
- AWS Workshops
- AWS Architecture Center
- numerous more (really)

I have a specific interest in Cloud Architecting (AWS, AZURE, GCP) as well as Network Architecting, Cyber Security Architecting, and Data Architecting ... (there's a small recursion joke in there).
Late 2023 I stated learning about Cloud solution architecting, however with my background in finance, remodeling, project management, design engineering and construction I feel translate incredibly well for a career in "Solving technological problems on how things need to be built the withstand not only loads but also breaches, all while within a almost zero-latency environment following the frameworks and models that work quite well laid out by the (AWS, Azure, GCP) Well architected framework, TOGAF, and many many others". Things need to be built well, with care, and to customer satisfaction. This I believe I have specific attention to detail and a strong 10 year record upholding.

There is also a strong history with customer satisfaction with projects I have been involved in, albeit not always within an agile environment, nor surrounded by technical roles, I think the values still integrate well. To make up for the fact that although I have a technical degree, which is not a CS degree, I spend quite a bit of my time reading handbooks and technical manuscripts, as well as working on diagrams and technical education already mentioned above. A few of my favorites include the O'Reilly, Packt, "Clean" Series (I have all 3 and they are wonderful), For Dummies series, AWS white paper, AWS documentation, and a few blogs. 
I hoard books what can I say. I have purchased already quite a few and I like to learn both at my leisure and for sport. I would personally prefer to work for a company that not only presents us with challenges to work on consistently but always highly values continuous education. Investing in continuing the education of their employees would be highly valuable to me. Just thought I'd throw that in there incase you've read this far. 
I personally believe challenges make us better engineers and architects.
